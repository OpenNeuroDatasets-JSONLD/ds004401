PS13 Molecular Imaging Brain Atlas (Kim 2021)

Molecular Imaging Brain Atlases MIBAs are analyzed PET data presented in a format that MRI researchers should find easy to use, including tables of values for default ROIs and volume and surface maps in traditional MRI-based coordinate systems

Public deidentified MRI and PET data were obtained from openneuro.org/datasets/ds004230/versions/2.2.5 for 16 subjects who underwent a [11C]PS13 PET scan, a radioligand that quantifies cyclooxygenase-1 [X]. MRI data were analyzed in FreeSurfer[X]. PET data were analyzed in PETsurfer ([X],surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PetSurfer) using the Logan method [X] to quantify the distribution volume (VT). A PS13 MIBA was generated by computing averages and standard deviations of VT across subject in ROI tables and in voxel-wise maps on the MNI152 and the FreeSurfer fsaverage brain.

Notes:
- The files `participants.json` and `participants.tsv` are from https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004332/versions/1.0.2
- The folder `sub-dummy` should be ignored.  It is only there so the dataset passes validation

Description of Files in derivatives/petsurfer/mibas/ps13-ds004230/nomc.nopvc.nosm.logan.ts540:
- fsaverage.lh.mean.nii.gz: Mean across subjects on the left hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- fsaverage.rh.mean.nii.gz: Mean across subjects on the right hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- fsaverage.lh.std.nii.gz: Standard deviation across subjects on the left hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- fsaverage.rh.std.nii.gz: Standard deviation across subjects on the right hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- mni152.lh.mean.nii.gz: Mean across subjects on the left hemisphere of the mni152 surface
