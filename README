A PET Molecular Imaging Brain Atlas of Cycloo\xygenase-1 (Kim 2021)

Molecular Imaging Brain Atlases MIBAs are analyzed PET data presented in a format that MRI researchers should find easy to use, including tables of values for default ROIs and volume and surface maps in traditional MRI-based coordinate systems

Public deidentified MRI and PET data were obtained from openneuro.org/datasets/ds004230/versions/2.2.5 for 16 subjects who underwent a [11C]PS13 PET scan, a radioligand that quantifies cyclooxygenase-1 [1]. MRI data were analyzed in FreeSurfer[2]. PET data were analyzed in PETsurfer ([3, 4],surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PetSurfer) using the Logan method [5] to quantify the distribution volume (VT). A Cyclooxygenase-1 MIBA was generated by computing averages and standard deviations of VT across subject in ROI tables and in voxel-wise maps on the MNI152 and the FreeSurfer fsaverage brain.

Notes:

- The files `participants.json` and `participants.tsv` are from https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004332/versions/1.0.2
- The folder `sub-dummy` should be ignored.  It is only there so the dataset passes validation

Description of Files in `derivatives/petsurfer/mibas/ps13-ds004230/nomc.nopvc.nosm.logan.ts540`:

- fsaverage.lh.mean.nii.gz: Mean across subjects on the left hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- fsaverage.rh.mean.nii.gz: Mean across subjects on the right hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- fsaverage.lh.std.nii.gz: Standard deviation across subjects on the left hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- fsaverage.rh.std.nii.gz: Standard deviation across subjects on the right hemisphere of the fsaverage surface
- mni152.mean.nii.gz: Mean across subjects in voxel-space
- mni152.std.nii.gz: Standard devation across subjects in voxel-space
- roi.mean.nii.gz: Means for the 100 ROIs defined in roi.csv.  Not viewable in a viewer, for compatibility with FreeSurfer tools (e.g. mri_glmfit)
- roi.std.nii.gz:  Standard devations for the 100 ROIs defined in roi.csv.  Not viewable in a viewer, for compatibility with FreeSurfer tools (e.g. mri_glmfit) 
- roi.csv: Text-based summary of roi.mean.nii.gz and roi.std.nii.gz
